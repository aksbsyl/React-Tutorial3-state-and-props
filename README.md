props:Suppose, We have parent component: App, having components: Navbar, form, Contact. 
If we have to pass data(eg: name)from App to Navbar ie if we have to pass data from one component to the other, we use props.
*props also known as properties are 'read-only'. So, if I have passed data from App to Navbar, I can't change of reassign data
from Navbar
*props is always passed from parent component to child component
*In functional based components, if we have to pick data from props we define parameter in funcion and take as this


state: is an object where we store all our data (eg: data from backend is pulled to frontend using ajx and stored in state
we keep all our data in state..


*Bootstrap: We use bootstrap to make our responsive
*use Navbar from bootstrap.com>Navbar
